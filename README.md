# Spongetext (C Version)

This C program is a rewrite of my JavaScript script (available [here](https://github.com/MrVideo/SpongeText)) in C, as a form of training.

This program takes a string from the user and converts it in SpongeText, then copies it to the user's clipboard.

Thanks to my friend [Lauchmelder](https://github.com/Lauchmelder23) (and StackOverflow) for the help!
